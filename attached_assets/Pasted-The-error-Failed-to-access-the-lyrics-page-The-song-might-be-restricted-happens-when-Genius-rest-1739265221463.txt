The error "Failed to access the lyrics page. The song might be restricted." happens when Genius restricts access to certain song lyrics due to their licensing policies or because the song is not available in the public API.

Possible Solutions:

1. Handling Restricted Songs:

Some songs may have their lyrics blocked via the Genius API, so when you search for them, it returns a restriction message.

Instead of giving up, we can improve error handling to check if the lyrics are available and provide feedback.



2. Ensure Song Availability:

Sometimes the song may be available but has restrictions. To better manage this, you can try searching for more popular songs or use a fallback option if the song is restricted.




Updated Error Handling:

We'll modify the code to check the availability of lyrics more robustly and handle restricted songs properly:

import lyricsgenius
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

# Initialize Genius API client with your API key
genius = lyricsgenius.Genius("YOUR_GENIUS_API_KEY")  # Replace with your Genius API key

@bot.command()
async def lyrics(ctx, *, song_name):
    await ctx.send("üîç Searching for lyrics...")

    try:
        # Search for the song using the Genius API
        song = genius.search_song(song_name)

        if song:
            # Check if the song has lyrics available
            if song.lyrics:
                lyrics = song.lyrics
                lyrics = lyrics[:2000]  # Limit the lyrics to 2000 characters for Discord

                # Create and send an embed with the lyrics
                embed = discord.Embed(title=f"üé§ Lyrics for {song_name}", description=lyrics, color=discord.Color.blue())
                embed.set_footer(text="Powered by Genius")
                await ctx.send(embed=embed)
            else:
                await ctx.send("‚ùå Lyrics are not available for this song.")
        else:
            await ctx.send("‚ùå Could not find the song on Genius.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        await ctx.send(f"‚ùå An error occurred while fetching the lyrics: {str(e)}")

Changes Made:

1. More Detailed Error Handling: The bot now gives a clearer message if the song is restricted or if there are no lyrics available.


2. Fallback Message: If the song is not found, the bot informs the user that it couldn't find the song.


3. Try-Except Block: This will catch any additional errors that might occur, ensuring the bot doesn't crash.

Test Again:

Run the bot and try the command !lyrics <song name>.

If the song is restricted, you should see a message like "Lyrics are not available for this song."


If the issue still persists with specific songs, the lyrics might truly be restricted, and switching to a different song would resolve it.

Let me know if it works!
